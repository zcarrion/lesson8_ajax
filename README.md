### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. AJAX is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page.  It can read data from webservers after the page load, it can be updated without reloading and send dta to the weberserver in the background.  It’s NOT a programming language, but a technique to access web servers.  It does not work by itself, but as a combination of XMLHttpRequest, Javascript, CSS and DOM.  The XMLHttpRequest object is supported by most modern browsers, but not all servers or browsers.  The response to an Ajax request usually comes in one of three formats; HTML, XML, or JSON.   
2. JSON which stands for JavaScript Object Notation is a subset of JS and is a lightweight data-interchange format, that is easy for humans to read and write, and to parse and generate.  Is commonly used to read data from a server and display the data in a web server.  It is built into the page.  The syntax rules are: data is in name/value pairs and separated by commas. Curly braces holds the objects and square brackets hold arrays.  It uses several DataTypes: Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object, value and null.
3. API are used in browsers, scripts, and by websites that share functionality with other programs or sites.  API’s let you write code that will make a request, asking another program or script to do something.  The API also specify the format in which the response will be given.  To use an API on the website, the script need to be included in the relevant web pages.
